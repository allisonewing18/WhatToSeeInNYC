                        90% Positive Reviews <br>Reviews: A hilarious British Musical that sheds light on such an important mission in WW2! Although some audiences find the British accents hard to understand at times, this show is jam packed with humor. With constant costume changes and impressive prop/scene work, you are always on the edge of your seat and laughing from beginning to end! Even while being such a powerful comedy, Operation Mincemeat knows how to balance the mood with a few powerful ballads and right the moral wrongs of the original operation. <br>

                        Cabaret <br> <br> 90% Positive Reviews <br>Reviews: In the beginning of their run, reviews were fantastic for this long-awaited arrival. However, reviews have dropped since Billy Porter joined the cast. Now at the time of writing, Cabaret is now closed due to this recent turn in reviews and attendence. <br>

                        Moulin Rougue <br> <br> 87% Positive Reviews <br>Reviews: Jukebox musicals are always tough to pull off, but Moulin Rougue makes a good effort at puttig on a fun spectacle full of songs everyone will know! Many criticize it's overly dramatic nature with a low stakes plot, but any Millenial or Gen Z audience member will know nearly every song! Although turning Katy Perry's Firework into a power ballad doesn't quite land, the remixes of songs like "Crazy" & "Rolling in the Deep" and "Shut Up and Dance" & "Raise Your Glass" with impressive coreography make this show a good time from curtain rise to fall!<br>
